# AP Computer Science A
> 2016-2017

## Overview

This year, APCS's curiculum was reformatted into two different types of activities - activities about learning Java, and activities that apply that knowledge in Android apps.
In general, the Java based projects are designed to be opened in [BlueJ](http://www.bluej.org/), while the Android projects are designed to be opened in Android Studio.
The app projects are generally stored in folders with the suffix _Android_.
