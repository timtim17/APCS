# APCS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timtim17/APCS.svg?branch=project-structure)](https://travis-ci.org/timtim17/APCS)

A simple project to test out an idea for a sort-of build system-like thing for my APCS projects.

## Ideas
- [X] Gradle multibuild (one build file per project, all compiled by one main build file)
- [X] JUnit Tests (optional - not every project has to have them)
- [X] Travis CI
- No artifacts generated or stored - plain code is submitted instead of JARs.
- Generate javadoc for gh-pages?
