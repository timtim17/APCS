# APCS

A simple project to test out an idea for a sort-of build system-like thing for my APCS projects.

## Ideas
- [ ] Gradle multibuild (one build file per project, all compiled by one main build file)
- [ ] JUnit Tests (optional - not every project has to have them)
- [ ] Travis CI
- No artifacts generated or stored - plain code is submitted instead of JARs.
- Generate javadoc for gh-pages?
